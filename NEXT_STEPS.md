## Testing Your Chatbot (10 minutes)

### Test Questions to Try:
1. "What are your main technical skills?"
2. "Tell me about your experience with machine learning"
3. "What programming languages do you know?"
4. "What projects have you worked on?"
5. "What cloud platforms are you familiar with?"

### Expected Behavior:
- ‚úÖ Bot responds in 1-2 seconds
- ‚úÖ Answers are relevant to your resume
- ‚úÖ Professional and friendly tone
- ‚úÖ First-person responses

---

## Optional: Train Fine-tuned Model (30 minutes)

If you want to showcase ML engineering skills on GitHub:

```bash
# This will take 10-20 minutes on M2 MacBook
python fine-tuning/train.py

# Then test it
python fine-tuning/evaluate.py
```

---

## Customization (15 minutes)

### Add More Q&A Pairs

Edit `data/process_data.py` and add to the `create_qa_pairs()` function:

```python
{
    "question": "What's your favorite project?",
    "answer": "I really enjoyed working on..."
},
```

### Customize the Frontend

Edit `rag-deployment/frontend/styles.css`:
- Change colors (search for `--primary-color`)
- Modify fonts
- Adjust layout

### Adjust Bot Personality

Edit `rag-deployment/backend/app.py` line 92:

```python
system_prompt = """You are a helpful and enthusiastic assistant..."""
```

---

## Push to GitHub (10 minutes)

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd jai-llm-chatbot
git init
git add .

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jai-llm-chatbot.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Add Topics (Tags)
On GitHub, add these topics to your repo:
- `artificial-intelligence`
- `chatbot`
- `machine-learning`
- `rag`
- `google-gemini`
- `portfolio-project`
- `llm`
- `python`
